            <td>THE BACKSTORY</td>
            <td>Sci-fi writers and dreamers have long envisioned ways to travel at high speeds through low-pressure tubes. Rocketry pioneer Robert Goddard in 1909 proposed a vacuum train very similar in concept to the Hyperloop. In 1972, the RAND Corp. conceived a supersonic underground railway called the Vactrain. The idea was waiting for the right combination of talent, technology, and business case to become a reality.</td>

             <td>SEEDING THE IDEA</td>
            <td>Traveling together on a humanitarian mission to Cuba, venture investor and entrepreneur Shervin Pishevar and Elon Musk get to talking about Musk’s idea for the Hyperloop, an update on the idea of moving vehicles at high speeds through low-pressure tubes. A few months later at a tech conference Shervin urges Musk to share his ideas with the public.</td>

The test stand is housed in an 18 cubic meter environment chamber that is capable of achieving pressures down to 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure. The rotor achieves surface speeds of up to 300 meters per second. These speeds are necessary to simulate Hyperloop cutting edge levitation systems for use on our test vehicles.</td>

It was designed, fabricated and built by the Hyperloop One team to test scaled axial compressor blades and aerodynamic structures in environments down to 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure. Powered by two 2,000 CFM vacuum pumps, the Blade Runner lets the Hyperloop One team conduct long-duration tests while adjusting flow variables in speeds ranging from subsonic through supersonic regimes.</td>
